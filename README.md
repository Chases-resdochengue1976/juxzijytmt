Just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Picture This, and man, my brain is struggling like a hamster on a treadmill. You ever finish a   and just go, What did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Like, it was this bizarre blend of emotions I didn't sign up for. I walked in expecting a rom-com, ended up with this weirdly sincere puzzle of all my teenage dreams and nightmares.

First off, the lead character, what’s her name again? Probably doesn’t matter. Let’s just call her Miss Trying-too-hard, kinda felt like they stuffed every teenage cliché from the last decade into a blender and hit annoy. There was this scene—Lord. She spends an eternity trying to ask this dude out, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat try to play fetch, and I’m sitting there, sipping my overpriced soda, thinking, why is this my life now?

> Oh, and the whole plot twist, like halfway through? It was as expected as a Monday morning with plumbing issues. I’m talking about replacing your bathroom tiles-level expected. But damn if I didn’t low-key love it. It’s like they were out there, trying to put together Ikea furniture with missing parts, and somehow it just, kinda, sort of, worked? Makes zero sense, I know. Who’s writing this script, a bunch of squirrels on caffeine?

And the photography—oh my god, it’s like someone got their hands on all the Instagram filters and just, you know, never put them down. The colors were okay? Like pastel vomited on my eyes and sometimes it was pretty. Sometimes. But then they’d cut to a scene where two characters attempt the most awkward dance since whatever happened at my cousin’s wedding, and it just felt weirdly beautiful? My brain’s confused.

Here's a random shoutout to the sidekick best friend—he was like the moral compass you don’t need but end up loving anyway, like a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ing faucet in a house you’ve grown fond of. Wise crappy advice, but somehow felt warm like your favorite old sweater.

// int loveStory = 0;
// for(int day = 0; day < 365; day++) {
// loveStory += (day % 10 == 0)? 1 : -1;
// }

By the end, I was both fed up and kind of charmed, which is a trick I didn’t know  s could pull. Do I wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 this   again? Eh, maybe not immediately. Do I wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for when I’m sick and need something for my brain to chew on? Probably, yes. Wouldn’t recommend it to my grandma, but if you’re in the mood for something eclectic to jostle your subpar week? Yeah, give it a whirl.
